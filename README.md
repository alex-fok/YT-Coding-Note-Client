# YTCodingNote Client

YT Coding Note is an application designed for observing changes of a codebase over time in Youtube coding tutorial videos. For each video, users can save a version of the codebase with an unique timestamp. As the video plays, the codebase is changed whenever the videoâ€™s duration passes a timestamp. This helps users to review prior changes, and thus improve their learning experience in coding.
